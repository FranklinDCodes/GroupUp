## Description

This is GroupUp! The website is organization agnostic, meaning it works whether you are in an educational setting, workplace setting, or anything else!

The flow of the website is as follows:
- Home Page
	- View of both the projects and groups the user is apart of
- Project Management Page
	- Accessed by clicking on a certain project
	- When in this view, the user is the project leader
	- They can view information about the project and build surveys to send out
	- View Responses Page
		- Accessed by clicking on a specific survey to view response data for
		- The project leader can either view aggregate data for likert questions or review responses before releasing them publicly
- Group Page
	- Accessed by clicking on a specific group. The groups listed in the dashboard are groups that the user is a member of.
	- From here, the group member can view information about other group members, fill out issued surveys, and view feedback they have received.

## Copilot Usage

Prompt: How can I iterate over an object in Javascript?
Purpose: I needed to access both the key and value for the group member info in Groups.js
Generated Code:
``` js
for (let key in myJSONObject) {  
	if (myJSONObject.hasOwnProperty(key)) {  
	console.log(key + ": " + myJSONObject[key]);  
	}  
}
```

Prompt: How would you recommend dynamically changing the side bar buttons depending on what page is being viewed? For example, if I am viewing a specific project. The side bar should have buttons for viewing groups, creating surveys, and viewing responses. However, if I am in the groups, the side bar should have buttons for viewing the members of the group, viewing feedback from group members, etc. How can I ensure that the buttons I want to be displayed are shown in the side bar as the user navigates through the website?
Purpose: I was mentally stuck trying to figure out a way to easily change the menu panel buttons.
Result: The idea to use a JSON object holding configurations in menuPanel.js

Prompt: How do you check the type of a variable in JS?
Result: I learned about the typeof operator in Javascript

Prompt: Copilot, can you help me create a dummy getSurveys function in my current file? I need it to return an array of all the surveys that the user has created. You need to make 3 small test surveys to return. This data will eventually be retrieved from an API, this is just a simulation.
Purpose: Have some sample data to display on the website
Code Generated:
``` js
function getSurveys() {
    const arrSurveys = [
        {
            surveyId: '001',
            title: 'Team Collaboration Survey',
            description: 'A survey to evaluate team collaboration and communication.',
            createdDate: '2025-04-01'
        },
        {
            surveyId: '002',
            title: 'Project Feedback Survey',
            description: 'A survey to gather feedback on the current project progress.',
            createdDate: '2025-04-05'
        },
        {
            surveyId: '003',
            title: 'Group Satisfaction Survey',
            description: 'A survey to measure group member satisfaction and engagement.',
            createdDate: '2025-04-10'
        }
    ];
    return arrSurveys;
}
```

Prompt: Why is arrResponses empty here?
Purpose: I was trying to get the responses to use as data for the charts. There was a bug that I could not figure out.
Code Generated:
``` js
// Copilot gave me the following code:
arrLikertQuestions.forEach(question => {
    console.log('Current Question: ');
    console.log(question);

    // Collect all responses for the current question
    let arrResponses = [];
    objSurvey.groupResponses.forEach(group => {
        group.memberResponses.forEach(member => {
            const answer = member.answers.find(ans => ans.questionid === question.questionid);
            if (answer) {
                arrResponses.push(answer.answer); // Collect the answer
            }
        });
    });

    console.log(`Responses for question "${question.questionText}":`);
    console.log(arrResponses);
});
```


Prompt: Copilot, can you create a survey builder for me? It should have the capability of creating a survey that contains multiple choice, likert, and short answer questions. I would like to have the ability to store responses of the survey, including the specific user that answered the survey. The survey is for the purpose of group evaluation.
Purpose: Due to time constraints, I was unable to learn how to effectively create a survey builder. We briefly experimented with Google Forms integration, but ultimately decided against it.
Code Generated: Nearly all of the code in surveyBuilder.js and surveyBuilder.html was generated by Copilot.

Prompt: Copilot, I need your help. I would like to display the survey responses that the group members made as stated earlier, but I want to display it in a manner such that the project leader sees the survey as it was given. For example, for likert questions, I want the project leader to see all of the options, and the chosen option bubbled in. Can you do this for me?
Purpose: Display a well formatted view of the survey answers that group members gave. 
Code Generated: displayGroupResponses function in viewResponses.js

Prompt: Copilot, can you help me with loading html for a specific survey? The loadSurvey function's job is to load a survey when the user clicks on a dashboard element. I am having trouble getting the html to load in the dashboard.
Purpose: The survey was not being added to the dashboard when the user clicked on a survey in the Group Page.
Code Generated:
``` js
// Iterate over each question in the survey and generate HTML
    objSurvey.questions.forEach(question => {
        // Create a container for the question
        let divQuestionContainer = document.createElement('div');
        divQuestionContainer.className = 'question-container mb-4';

        // Add the question text
        let objQuestionText = document.createElement('h4');
        objQuestionText.innerHTML = question.questionText;
        divQuestionContainer.appendChild(objQuestionText);

  
        // Generate the options or input field based on the question type
        if (question.questionType === 'likert' || question.questionType === 'multipleChoice') {
            question.options.forEach(option => {
                let divOption = document.createElement('div');
                divOption.className = 'form-check';

                let inputOption = document.createElement('input');
                inputOption.className = 'form-check-input';
                inputOption.type = 'radio';
                inputOption.name = `question-${question.questionid}`;
                inputOption.id = `option-${question.questionid}-${option}`;
                inputOption.disabled = true; // Disable input since this is for viewing

                let labelOption = document.createElement('label');
                labelOption.className = 'form-check-label';
                labelOption.setAttribute('for', `option-${question.questionid}-${option}`);
                labelOption.innerHTML = option;
                divOption.appendChild(inputOption);
                divOption.appendChild(labelOption);
                divQuestionContainer.appendChild(divOption);
            });

        } else if (question.questionType === 'shortAnswer') {
            let inputShortAnswer = document.createElement('textarea');
            inputShortAnswer.className = 'form-control';
            inputShortAnswer.placeholder = 'Short answer text';
            inputShortAnswer.disabled = true; // Disable input since this is for viewing
            divQuestionContainer.appendChild(inputShortAnswer);
        }

  

        // Append the question container to the dashboard
        document.querySelector('#divDashboard').appendChild(divQuestionContainer);
    });
```

Prompt: How can I ensure a new div is added for every chart made?
Purpose: A visual bug was occurring when a bar chart was added in the View Responses Page.
Code Generated:
``` js
// Create a new div for the chart
    const chartDiv = document.createElement('div');
    chartDiv.className = 'chart-container'; // Optional: Add a class for styling
    chartDiv.id = `chart-${question.questionid}`; // Unique ID for the chart
    document.querySelector('#divCharts').appendChild(chartDiv);
    
    // Create the chart inside the new div
    createBarChart(arrXAxis, arrYAxis, strName, chartDiv.id);

function createBarChart(arrXAxis, arrYAxis, strName, chartDivId) {
    const options = {
        chart: {
            type: 'bar'
        },
        series: [{
            name: strName,
            data: arrYAxis
        }],
        xaxis: {
            categories: arrXAxis
        }
    };
    const chart = new ApexCharts(document.querySelector(`#${chartDivId}`), options);
    chart.render();
}
```

Prompt: Can you help me dynamically create a header above each chart that is the question.questionText?
Purpose: A visual bug was occurring when I tried to create a header for the bar chart.
Code Generated:
```js
// Create a container div for the chart and its header
    const chartContainer = document.createElement('div');
    chartContainer.className = 'chart-container'; // Optional: Add a class for styling

    // Create a header for the chart
    const chartHeader = document.createElement('h2');
    chartHeader.textContent = question.questionText; // Set the header text
    chartHeader.className = 'chart-header'; // Optional: Add a class for styling
    chartContainer.appendChild(chartHeader); // Append the header to the container

    // Create a new div for the chart
    const chartDiv = document.createElement('div');
    chartDiv.id = `chart-${question.questionid}`; // Unique ID for the chart
    chartContainer.appendChild(chartDiv); // Append the chart div to the container

    // Append the container to the main charts div
    document.querySelector('#divCharts').appendChild(chartContainer);
```

Prompt: What is wrong with my forEach loop?
Purpose: When developing the back button, I made a function findPreviousPage() to iterate over the menu panel button configurations to determine the previous page, but my forEach loop was never returning anything.
Result: Copilot taught me that forEach loops cannot be exited early.

Prompt: Why is the projects plus button not in-line with the projects header?
Result: Fixed minor error I had when setting the flexbox class in projects.js project plus button creation.
